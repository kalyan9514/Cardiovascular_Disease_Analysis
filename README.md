## Predictive Modeling and Risk Factor Analysis Using Machine Learning

**Problem:** 
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a leading cause of death globally, despite medical advancements.

**Goal:** 
Reduce deaths from CVDs by identifying key risk factors and developing preventative solutions.

**Project Aim:**

* Analyze the prevalence of CVDs across various populations.
* Identify major and minor factors contributing to CVD development.
* Develop strategies for early detection and prevention.

**Methodology:**

* Data collection and analysis: gather and clean data on CVDs and risk factors.
* Risk factor identification: explore the impact of different factors on CVD development.
* Develop preventative solutions: create strategies to address identified risk factors.

**Expected Outcomes:**

* Improved understanding of CVD risk factors and their influence.
* Early detection methods for preventing CVD complications.
* Reduced mortality rates from cardiovascular diseases.

**Project Deliverables:**

* Report outlining key findings and risk factors.
* Recommendations for preventative measures and early detection.
